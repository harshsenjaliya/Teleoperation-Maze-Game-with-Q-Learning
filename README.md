# Teleoperation-Maze-Game-with-Q-Learning
This project presents a comprehensive study of the Teleoperation Maze Game, a two-dimensional grid-based puzzle where a robot must push and pull a movable block to a designated exit. Implemented in Python with Pygame, the system supports both manual teleoperation and autonomous control via tabular Q-learning.
