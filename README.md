# Teleoperation Maze Game with Q-Learning

A Python/Pygame simulation and reinforcement-learning framework where a mobile agent must **push** and **pull** a movable block through a procedurally generated maze to a goal. Supports both:

- **Manual teleoperation** via keyboard (WASD or arrow keys)  
- **Autonomous control** via tabular Q-learning with reward shaping

## üîé Features

- **Procedural Maze Generation**  
  - Random walls (`p=0.1`) with a central ‚Äúsafe zone‚Äù to guarantee connectivity  
  - Deterministic via user-supplied seed  
- **Teleoperation Dynamics**  
  - Move, Push, Pull, and collision mechanics in a grid world  
- **Solvability Checker**  
  - Two-phase BFS to filter out unsolvable layouts before play or training  
- **Reinforcement Learning**  
  - Tabular Q-learning (`Œ±=0.1`, `Œ≥=0.95`, Œµ-greedy)  
  - Dense reward shaping (step penalty, contact bonuses, distance reward, collision/jiggle penalties, goal/failure rewards, baseline adjustment)  
- **Real-Time Visualization**  
  - Pygame UI with modes for Manual, Training, Testing, and Results  
- **Generalization**  
  - High success on held-out mazes (~80‚Äì90% on unseen layouts)
